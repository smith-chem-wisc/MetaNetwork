<h2>Annotation of GO Identifiers to their Biological Process Offspring</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set describes associations between GO molecular function (BP)
terms and their offspring BP terms, based on the directed acyclic
graph (DAG) defined by the Gene Ontology Consortium. The format is an R
object mapping the GO BP terms to all offspring terms, where an
offspring term is a more specific GO term that is preceded
by the given GO term in the DAG (in other words, the children and all
their children, etc.).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Each GO BP term is mapped to a vector of offspring GO BP terms.
</p>
<p>Biological process is defined as the broad biological goals, such as
mitosis or purine metabolism, that are accomplished by ordered
assemblies of molecular functions as defined by Gene Ontology
Consortium.
</p>
<p>Mappings were based on data provided by: Gene Ontology

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
## select() interface:
## Objects in this package can be accessed using the select() interface
## from the AnnotationDbi package. See ?select for details.

## Bimap interface:
# Convert the object to a list
xx &lt;- as.list(GOBPOFFSPRING)
# Remove GO IDs that do not have any offspring
xx &lt;- xx[!is.na(xx)]
if(length(xx) &gt; 0){
  # Get the offspring GO IDs for the first two elents of xx
  goids &lt;- xx[1:2]
}
